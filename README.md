## Testing

Manually tested creating, updating and deleting while logged out
Result: Redirected to login in each case, if logged out can only view bookings

Manually tested form validation:

Name: Must not be empty
Number of guests: Must be a whole number (field type itself enforces this), must be greater than zero
Reservation date/time: Must be a valid date, cannot be in the past (including the current day but a past time on that day)
Phone number: Must be between 8 and 15 digits, can contain + at start, spaces, or dashes, but these are not included in count, must not contain any other characters (e.g. letters)

Manually tested deleting and updating a record not made by user, as a non-admin:
Result: Change was not made, user is alerted that they don't have permission to do that

Manually tested deleting and updating a record not made by user, as an admin:
Result: Change was made, as admin has permission to change or delete any record

Tested responsiveness using Google browser and manually resizing window, all elements are visible in all cases, works across all screen sizes

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The project is deployed using Heroku. To deploy the project:

1. Create a database using PostgreSQL
2. Go to the dashboard and select the database just created.
3. Copy the URL (you can click the clipboard icon to copy)

#### **Heroku app setup**

  1. From the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click the new button in the top right corner and select create new app.
  2. Give your app a name (this must be unique), select the region that is closest to you and then click the create app button bottom left.
  3. Open the settings tab and create a new config var of `DATABASE_URL` and paste the database URL you copied from elephantSQL into the value (the value should not have quotation marks around it).

#### **Preparation for deployment in GitPod**

1. Install dj_database_url and psycopg2 (they are both needed for connecting to the external database you've just set up):

   ```bash
   pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
   ```

2. Update your requirements.txt file with the packages just installed:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

3. In settings.py underneath import os, add `import dj_database_url`

4. Find the section for DATABASES and comment out the code. Add the following code below the commented out database block, and use the URL copied from PostgreSQL for the value:

    (NOTE! don't delete the original section, as this is a temporary step whilst we connect the external database. Make sure you don't push this value to GitHub - this value should not be saved to GitHub, it will be added to the Heroku config vars in a later step, this is temporary to allow us to migrate our models to the external database)

    ```python
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse('paste-postgresql-db-url-here')
    }
    ```

5. In the terminal, run the show migrations command to confirm connection to the external database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

6. If you have connected the database correctly you will see a list of migrations that are unchecked. You can now run migrations to migrate the models to the new database:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Create a superuser for the new database. Input a username, email and password when directed.

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

8. You should now be able to go to the browser tab on the left of the page in elephantsql, click the table queries button and see the user you've just created by selecting the auth_user table.
9. We can now add an if/else statement for the databases in settings.py, so we use the development database while in development (the code we commented out) - and the external database on the live site (note the change where the db URL was is now a variable we will use in Heroku):

    ```python
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
          'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')
          }
        }
    ```

10. Install gunicorn which will act as our webserver and freeze this to the requirements.txt file:

    ```bash
    pip3 install gunicorn
    pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

11. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory. This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which runs gunicorn and serves our django app. Add the following to the file (making sure not to leave any blank lines underneath):

    ```Procfile
    web: gunicorn seaside_sewing.wsgi:application
    ```

12. Log into the Heroku CLI in the terminal and then run the following command to disable collectstatic. This command tells Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:

    ```bash
    heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
    ```

13. We will also need to add the Heroku app and localhost (which will allow GitPod to still work) to ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] in settings.py:

    ```python
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['{heroku deployed site URL here}', 'localhost' ]
    ```

14. Save, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub. You can then also initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with:

    ```bash
    heroku git:remote -a {app name here}
    git push heroku master
    ```

15. You should now be able to see the deployed site (without any static files as we haven't set these up yet).

16. To enable automatic deploys on Heroku, go to the deploy tab and click the connect to GitHub button in the deployment method section. Search for the projects repository and then click connect. Click enable automatic deploys at the bottom of the page.

### Local Development

#### **How to Fork**

To fork the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [reservation](https://github.com/aaronodonoghue96/pp4-reservation).

3. Click on the fork button in the top right of the page.

#### **How to Clone**

To clone the repository:

1. Log in (or sign up) to GitHub.

2. Go to the repository for this project, [reservation](https://github.com/aaronodonoghue96/pp4-reservation).

3. Click the Code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or the GitHub CLI and copy the link given.

4. Open the terminal in your chosen IDE and change the current working directory to the location you would like to use for the cloned repository.

5. Type the following command into the terminal `git clone` followed by the link you copied in step 3.

6. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required if you are using the Code Institute template and have opened the repository in GitPod as this will have been set up for you).

7. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
